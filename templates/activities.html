I've participated in scouts since third grade, jumping over ditches and this
time, actually wading through grass and water, cleaning up trash left over from
untidy campers and visitors. I have been a troop guide, troop instructor,
patrol leader, and librarian. This means I've lead and organized patrols for
long treks through the forest as well as on campouts, and more recently, taught
younger scouts - helping them to ascend the ranks to Eagle! In addition, I
participate in most of the Eagle Scout projects that my troop does, helping
troop boys as they have helped me in the past, and also all of the volunteer
activities - the next one being a food drive.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Though I haven't been doing this as long as a few of
my other activities, it ranks high among my favorite easily. To me, being a YAC
member means planning out all of the Botball tournaments and thinking how can
we help to make them work better and more accessible! It means, me standing on
a chair awkwardly setting up cameras in front of an audience of a few hundred
people at the International Botball Conference - GCER. Those cameras, which I
later connected using RCA cables, were the backbone of the web streaming
service I and YAC runs, though I was responsible for it at GCER. In addition, I
set up the electronics for around 60 tables, and taped all of it down. We went
through around 6 rolls of gaffers tape, and I got some exercise running around!
It means looking at a giant library of code, which one of the VPs and I am
working on, in order to make the upcoming regionals function better and more
accurately start the robots. It also means I'll be running for President in
January 2013!</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This club is one in which I did
not have formally a &lsquo;position&rsquo; role, and sadly could not run for one this year
due to mentorship which does not allow it :(. However that did not in the
slightest mean that I could not help out! Last year it was around the beginning
of the year when my team submitted our first fuzzy - or Future Problem
Situation - solution. It was on a future ecological problem, pollution in the
coral reef. We thought the main issue of a program that aimed to send a
scientist year round to test the coral reef was that he himself would disturb
the environment and cause for pollution. Soon later after another problem set
we reached states! I looked at the topic and loved it, it was economics. I
asked if anyone wanted a copy of a vocab sheet I was going to make as I wanted
to look up some ideas and terms in preparation. This then was expanded to
become a club wide project to make a study guide for States! At States one of
our ideas was to bring back Gandhi to help organize the Italian economy,
stagnated in our future scene. When we came back, I helped to modify the
constitution and try to organize a middle school invitational and outreach!</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11, 12</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So quickly some background, when
I joined, the team only allowed Juniors and Seniors after they took the
robotics or prototyping courses. I was confused why, many other teams allowed
any interested individual to participate and actually encouraged underclassmen
since they would be able to accumulate experience better as they would stay
longer. As a result of my lobbying, and soon my teammates, we now allow
sophmores! :) . It's not everyone, but it's a start. As a junior I was the
assistant lead of programming and electronics - two separate 'teams', or so I
would say. In reality it was one senior for electronics and another for
programming with one 'understudy' in both - me. This meant that I striped wires
and checked readings for electronics and then switched to develop computer
vision algorithms using the National Instruments Library. I had fun doing it
though, arriving early every Saturday and staying till the latest I could! This
year, I'm part of electronics and programming again, but they now have three or
so people per team. My role is more of an accessory one for now, helping fix
some bugs until the season starts, at which point I'll be wiring and coding
again! Regretfully I still won't be able to be the leads of both teams due to
mentorship, which doesn't allow one to attend club periods, so I will be an
assistant lead again!</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Since
elementary school I have volunteered, first at my school library, then the
regional one, and then at various programs, such as the Red Cross Fairfax Field
Office. My favorite volunteering to talk about though is the volunteering I do
at TJ - the popular abbreviation for my high school. So the volunteering I do
there is the only time I can say I skip around doing math, which I think is the
most fun thing to say! I mean who else can say they had fun with math AND while
teaching middle schoolers! In this case it was teaching them proofs and AMC
style problems for TJIMO - TJ's Math Invitational for Middle Schoolers.
Similarly I volunteered for TJ's Techstravaganza where I taught water cycles
and the aerodynamics of a paper plane to middle schoolers! And in TJ
Spontaneous, I organized the event so that the 3 hour delay, suddenly disappeared
... which actually made me part of the organizing committee this year
ironically. So I think though I can volunteer at other places and do quite
frequently, my favorite place to volunteer is at TJ because I get to teach
other students and middle schoolers :)! Also math is supposed to be fun, I
think skipping around doing math is the closest you can get (something my team
did during TJIMO)!</span></p>
