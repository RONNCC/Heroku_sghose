If an application essay is supposed to be ~250 words.. is it not easier to look at a picture, which is supposed to be ~1000? :) &lt;/explanatory_note> --></span>

       I'll be visiting the campus on 12/7/2012 and will visit CSAIL and a few CS classes hopefully; though my friend's class: 6.854 finished sadly.
    &lt;<span style="color:#268bd2;font-weight:700">papers</span>>
So in addition to what I've written on my app; I've published a paper at GCER - the Global Conference in Education Robotics on common coding errors and given two presentations: "Color Spaces and Color Models" and "Storing Code Online". The first being how the eye processes light and then how computer process / use colors and color models. The second was cloud storage of code and applications.
    &lt;/<span style="color:#268bd2;font-weight:700">papers</span>>
    &lt;<span style="color:#268bd2;font-weight:700">website</span>>&lt;<span style="color:#268bd2;font-weight:700">text</span>>
         Please visit the website 
        &lt;<span style="color:#268bd2;font-weight:700">link</span> <span style="color:#93a1a1">href</span>=<span style="color:#269186"><span style="color:#c60000">"</span>http://graphvis.herokuapp.com/<span style="color:#c60000">"</span></span>/>. I'm not the best at website design, so sorry for the bad graphics. 
      &lt;/<span style="color:#268bd2;font-weight:700">text</span>>&lt;/<span style="color:#268bd2;font-weight:700">website</span>>     
    &lt;<span style="color:#268bd2;font-weight:700">notes</span>>
       Also there is my Github which is at &lt;<span style="color:#268bd2;font-weight:700">link</span> <span style="color:#93a1a1">href</span>=<span style="color:#269186"><span style="color:#c60000">"</span>https://github.com/RONNCC/<span style="color:#c60000">"</span></span>/>
       though I've only uploaded ~10% of my code to it... it also has some other projects and will soon have a
 complex analysis answer key that i'm working on; I accidentally lost some of the pages... I'm  currently beginning to contribute to scikits-learn and graph-tool (open source projects);
 both have github repos. In addition it has some Machine Learning code in Octave under /Sandbox 
    &lt;/<span style="color:#268bd2;font-weight:700">notes</span>>
    &lt;<span style="color:#268bd2;font-weight:700">Recs</span>>
       My part A recommendation should be received in the next week or so. My teacher says that due to Hurricane 
Sandy and an accident in which he cut his hand, he has not yet been able to send it. I'll also be sending an additional 
req later in the year if you allow it from my MITRE supervisor.
    &lt;/<span style="color:#268bd2;font-weight:700">Recs</span>>&lt;/<span style="color:#268bd2;font-weight:700">me</span>>
  &lt;<span style="color:#268bd2;font-weight:700">Additional_Hobbies</span>>&lt;<span style="color:#268bd2;font-weight:700">Courses</span>>
       I like taking tons of courses but due to time restrictions / course load / pre-reqs without placement tests, I can't :(.
 So i'm trying to find a quantum mechanics class nearby but can't at the moment, it seems GMU doesn't have one. - so I'll try to
 take Modern Physics at NVCC since that's the closest they have. At TJ parallel computing took my the space that quantum would have - so I couldn't take both :(. 
      &lt;<span style="color:#268bd2;font-weight:700">EDX</span>>
         Buhahaha (**insert evil laugh**) so since I can't take in person courses, Edx is wonderful for learning! 
I'm taking three courses on it now: I'm taking Computer Graphics ~ from Berkeley,
Solid State Chem from MIT and the Quantitative Statistics in Public Health from Harvard. I must
 say you guys have the coolest certificates around ~ with the MD5 hash, the SHA encryption and the validation I'm somewhat jealous - 
my friend showed me his 6.002x certificate. Sadly you don't have many courses :( so in addition i'm taking some at Coursera - 
the rival from Stanford. I've taking Machine Learning (going to get a certificate soon) and a UPENN "Networked Life"
 one - i have a "Honors with Distinction - 100%" certificate... interesting look at Erdos-Renyi models and real life graph theory ^^.
 Right now i'm taking a Stanford Human-Computer Interface - hopefully my UI will look a little better as a result, a Georgia Tech 
Computational Finance one and a UIUC Parallel Computing One! 
      &lt;/<span style="color:#268bd2;font-weight:700">EDX</span>> &lt;/<span style="color:#268bd2;font-weight:700">Courses</span>>   
  &lt;/<span style="color:#268bd2;font-weight:700">Additional_Hobbies</span>>
  &lt;<span style="color:#268bd2;font-weight:700">Disclaimer</span>>
     So if I'm unable to get into MIT this year; I'll be applying next year... (for n+1 years) as a transfer student / visiting grad as well. 
See you then :P ; oh and if I somehow get into a fellowship program at MIT that lets in undergrads :). 
Also can you work in the Admissions office as an undergrad? 
  &lt;/<span style="color:#268bd2;font-weight:700">Disclaimer</span>>
  &lt;<span style="color:#268bd2;font-weight:700">Picture</span>>
     So I really wanted to put a picture in an app, but no colleges like pictures, so the best I can do is put a link. 
    &lt;<span style="color:#268bd2;font-weight:700">link</span> <span style="color:#93a1a1">href</span>=<span style="color:#269186"><span style="color:#c60000">"</span>http://i.imgur.com/lIXeh.jpg<span style="color:#c60000">"</span></span>/> -> essentially my app in a picture. and then just a generally nice picture: 
&lt;<span style="color:#268bd2;font-weight:700">link</span> <span style="color:#93a1a1">href</span>=<span style="color:#269186"><span style="color:#c60000">"</span>http://i.imgur.com/uSGrx.jpg<span style="color:#c60000">"</span></span>/> And the cute animals don't hurt either :).
  &lt;/<span style="color:#268bd2;font-weight:700">Picture</span>>
  &lt;<span style="color:#268bd2;font-weight:700">Last_Comment</span>>
     So I think this is the most fun app I've written so far! :) I think this is more of a blog post (even though I don't blog?) 
than an app though....
