{document.getElementById("text").innerHTML="I can honestly say that I participate in teaching for the pleasure of it. I think I can say the the look of understanding that comes on a students face is sort of like ... an achievement in of itself and is an awesome thing :). ... if that makes sense. In addition, teaching helps me find things I don't know and learn more about them! The best proof of this is that I'm magically able to arrive half an hour early to it while for many other things i'm a good ten minutes late despite my efforts &gt;_&lt;. (I'm not the most time-coordinated person around). I'm not part of the clubs that run the activities, but via some smiling and dedication I'm able to participate in almost all of them - one was closed to members of the club :(. As a result somehow I'm one of the leaders for an invitational we're running in January where we invite middle schoolers to participate in an Odyssey of the Mind style competition. Additionally, I was one of the senior coaches last week when we teaching Proofs to a different set of middle schoolers at TJIMO! - I think the part where we literally skipped around the school doing math problems was the best part :). (Of course, I'll be requesting leave to come and participate in it again and will be part of the MIT Educational Studies Program during the Summer!)<br> As a sort of addedendum I find 1) questions and 2) taking things apart to be fun.<br> See you would think these might be unrelated, but actually to me they're the same thing.I love asking questions because I like figuring out more, or just wondering what happens if you do this or that. A response I've been getting recently is 'hmm well I think this: Maybe that will be your Ph.D project' :P. From this, taking things apart is just the next step! Though I don't have an accelerator, and unlike Dr. Michio Kaku I haven't tried building a betatron. Though if you have a spare car around I would be really interested in trying to take that apart :)";}

{document.getElementById("text").innerHTML="So I have two things for this: perseverance - one of more typical ones, and randomness (but not really entropy)!<br> <br>I am a persevering individual and strive to excel in all aspects of life, from academic success, to personal relationships. My journey through scouting has introduced me to the excitement of travel, camping, and archery. I held the position of Patrol leader, librarian, troop guide and den chief over my scouting journey which reinforced my leadership and perseverance skills. I learnt essential life skills like resilience and flexibility during my struggle with unforeseen weather predicaments while climbing Old Rag and experiencing exciting canoeing adventures. On one of my hiking expeditions we were halfway up the mountain when extreme heat, diminishing water supplies and medical conditions (foot sores) caused half of the Scouting group to turn back. I rallied to team members to keep going; after all accomplishing difficult missions under dire conditions was part of the Scout goals. It was a challenge we had completed half way and perseverance was part of the Scout law! I believe this demonstrated endurance and the ability to persevere with the task I had started, a quality that kept me stoic in moments of a family medical crisis last year when my mom needed my assistance on financial matters, handyman tasks and from the emotional support perspective. In addition,<br>I am proud of my bookishness, though I admit it occasionally distracts from school assignments. By reading everything I find, I learn more for the sheer sake of knowing; if it's in a foreign language, that just means more to learn - the physicist Landau was Polish! (yes I have a picture of a stack of books almost my height, if anyone wants it xD)<br><br>Randomness:<br>I let out a disappointing sigh in defeat as another person walked away. I simply had to wait for another one to come. &quot;Hey, this is crazy, but what's up!?&quot; A smile sat on my face as I scanned the newcomer. He wondered why I, a nondescript person in the hall had called out as he walked<br>by, a seemingly random coincidence or was it? For him maybe, for me not at all; by that time I was an aspiring amateur learning the ways of approaching strangers. Socrates said that if you're the smartest in the room, you're in the wrong room. My take is slightly different: if you're bored, you must be in a room by yourself. I find it fun to meet strangers; if you never approach them, you're missing out on a whole group of people! Last week I walked up to a girl during a fire drill; she looked like my friend and had the same last name on the back of her sweatshirt. When she turned around, I was shocked. I found out that my new friend had that happen frequently and learned a bit about someone new! :). YUP. I'll be randomly walking around MIT saying &quot;HI&quot; and smiling! Yup - even when i shadow (which is 12/7)... though I need to get a shirt that says free hugs also since that sounds fun :D !";}

{document.getElementById("text").innerHTML="CS! I love doing computer science and thinking of clever solutions to<br>problems.. though I admit, I also try to play the &quot;how short can I make this<br>code game&quot;... (I've spent quite a bit trying to get an A* Search to 10 lines<br>in Python... I'm at 11 and stuck on how to compress a while loop -&gt;<br>everything else is compressed in a giant set of 4-deep nested list<br>comprehensions &gt;:D .. via some boolean combinations I think I can condense the code to 9... but I don't think Python will let me condense it further. ~ Time to try it in Haskell.). So I love doing computer science because it's elegant!<br>-I think pretty code can easily rival a math proof, and even the four-dimensional version of Maxwell's Equation, which nicely takes all 8 cases into one equation. Also I think computer science is somewhat of a leveler t's &quot;level&quot; - no matter<br>how complicated your algorithm or how complicated the proof behind it is,<br>when it comes down to it, its one language free of special notations and<br>comes in a complete package, no needed lemmas; though you might be digging around in source code for some time, sort of like me and some kernel method code in Scikit-Learn (A python Machine Learning Library I'm using). Most likely though, it's just fun. I started programming when I was around 7? and modded the AI in a game I was playing. Somehow from there I went up to the 'newer' languages and find myself where I am today ~ though I don't know how much better my web graphics have gotten.";}

{document.getElementById("text").innerHTML="**Bring-Bring**. Somewhere in the background I hear a telephone; &quot;Don't pick it <br>up!&quot; my dad shouts; this is common by now as it's not an actual call but a <br>modem. A year or two later we're using broadband and I'm not sure why we ever <br>used a modem. At dinner I hear things like &quot;I'm working on a new project&quot; and <br>&quot;waterfall and agile paradigms&quot;, somehow these connect with company names <br>such as &quot;MCI&quot; and &quot;Discovery&quot;. I don't really know how but the word IT jumps <br>into the mix headfirst now as well. My dad has a degree as an electrical <br>engineer while my mom has hers in economics; where does &quot;Waterfall&quot; come <br>into that? <br>I find out later it doesn't. It's actually one of the different software <br>development cycle ideas. At maybe 10 I see my dad feverishly talking on a <br>phone, my mom says to my grandmother: 'they had an attack at work'. In my <br>mind this means dashing villains backwards flipping into sports cars with <br>swarms of police at the back. Nope, wrong again; it meant an intrusion; a <br>cybersecurity attack. This may be how I picked up my idea of swimming &acirc;?&brvbar; into <br>source code as an idea of fun; or it might be when I decided one of my <br>computer games was boring and I could make it better. Somehow now though, I <br>find myself coding if I need to do small things ~ copy and rename a bunch of <br>files, or writing a small script to output vector fields for physics. When <br>asked about it, I find myself saying it's more of a fun thing rather than <br>work; only somehow I've now found as an intern at MITRE, it's somehow work as <br>well. Though I find it really fun, my extension to this at MIT I think will be that I'll be jumping around CSAIL working on things :) ! Oh and meeting professors, that sounds fun.";}

{document.getElementById("text").innerHTML="So for this I have two things: a slight challenge and a fun solution... to two different things. I would like to touch on both! Sorry if things don't come out very well - much like the MIT interview I consider essays casual conversations.<br><br>For the first:<br><br>A challenge I live with is recurrent migraines. In my junior year in Thomas Jefferson, when grades and extracurricular balance were of paramount importance, my dad was paralyzed with Guillain Barre Syndrome. While he was suddenly hanging on to life, my mom was frantic with emotional and financial worries, my brother seemed sullen and uncooperative and I experienced, for the first time, unbearable headaches called &quot;migraines&quot;. <br>This meant a pain when there was talking... repetitive music, or even bright lights. When not visiting my dad, nausea kept me hidden in my dark bedroom. School absences prompted doctor recommendations ranging from prescription pills to inhalers that knocked me out.<br><br>My migraines manifest as a pulsating pain on one side of the head, though they are happy to bounce around like a pinball machine. The doctors told me migraines are triggered by factors like stress, not unusual given my dad's situation but not helpful given my situation.<br>If I had to attribute to the experience a lesson, it would be the power to accept.  I had to accept living with my condition and my family's emergency situation the best way possible. After all, what does not kill you makes you stronger ... and hungry. I helped my mom the best I could, drank lots of water, ate more fruits and vegetables, and maintained a journal of migraine triggers. This year, my dad is partially recovered, my migraines are less frequent, and I am beginning to fully manage them.<br><br>For the second:<br>Last year when participating in TJ Spontaneous Invitational, organizing a room of loud children and surprisingly sometimes parents, the main event was pushed back by three hours; it seemed that many of the staff and even teams showed up late. This meant that suddenly all of the rooms were overfilled and a few hours behind schedule. To be slightly less vague, this mean't me running betwen the coaches and each of the rooms checking exactly how many kids could be put where and how to optimize it ~ actually I was thinking if I could run a genetic algorithm to do scheduling this year, in a manner similar to the way courses are scheduled at some universities in Spain and I think Columbia. I had a fun time organizing with coaches and other rooms to push the thing back on schedule ~ as a result it's now my job for the TJ 2013 Invitiational :D.";}

"I think MIT should have something about 'social nerdism' in your...admissions ..pamphlets.If you magically read this far, thank you! ~ can you please pass on my appreciation to the MIT Admissions Student Bloggers, oh and the faculty. That sort of non 'superpolished' writing - even though that's magnitudes of order higher than mine :P - is a GIANT relief. For other colleges I feel like I'm throwing paper at a brick wall, and some people magically walk through it. At least here I know that it's going somewhere :).Oh so social nerdism ~ this seems to have been used before so I can't be the first to say it, a path similar to the one my idea about pillow ties went :P. MIT seems to be a place in which ... education + fun + social + science + tech + awesome + everything good about education collides. ~ something I'll have a chance to verify when I visit - though I doubt my opinion will change. i think the BEST example of what I'm trying to say in a phrase is <b>MIT Gungnam Style</b>! >> It looks really fun to be able to dance with Chomsky by the way.<br> <h3>ProblemSet/CourseStuff?/Why MIT?</h3> So your problem sets.... seem amazing! As in ... they are... how can I put this... actual learning work? From the interviewer and my friends at MIT (oh and I was able to see one or two of them after they were relased), they are thinking outside of the box problem sets. The one my interviewer told me was calculate the time it takes to reach Harvard From MIT by driving. In this you made all the assumptions and made it as complicated or simple as you like. I think this is possibly the ... for lack of a better expression ... BEST! sort of problem ever. Rather than rote memorization and formula application, you can think about what you're doing and work on it :) rather than just 'chug away' ... sorry for the vagueness - I don't know how to appropriately convey what I'm seeing/thinking/blah.

"<p><h3>Random Me Things</h3>So as you can probably tell right now, i'm not the best organized person around ~ or the best with respect to (w.r.t) time management ~ finding things is sort of a difference equation with a substantial step. This means I wake up earlier and randomly bounce around from sleep deprivation sometimes ~ quite the contrary from what you would expect. But that's ok! I like using smileys and smiling, because otherwise the world is really quite boring, oh and i'm horrible at rhyming.... or timing... hehe. I like telling bad science puns ~ to a chorus of groans ~ (What did the proton say to the electron when the later was mad? ~ You're being too negative). Oh and I love libraries because I feel like there's a GIANT amount of knowledge literally SITTING RIGHT THERE! ~ Waiting for me to open it ._. though I admit I get sidetracked sometimes -> like spending a few hours balancing some books hehe. Also I have a tower of books as tall as me ~ though I haven't calculated it 's c.o.m. . How long can undergrads check out books? :( MITRE through the Industrial Liason Program only allows me to get them for 28 days. </p> <p>Also I want to try writing one of those blogs! It looks really fun! ... and I like the cross enrollment and HASS reqs ~ it's  a good excuse for a want-to-be engineer like me to take history (*cough**cough* medieval and russian history *cough* classes). Also I want to take Chinese + French Classes! The former because they have amazing mathematicians as well and the latter because I really would like to visit CERN and the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne!<br> On a slightly more sobering note: as you can see I'm not a perfect gpa student. And at MIT (not to in anyway say that this is easily or even through a gigantic amount of effort achievable) I won't be a perfect student miraculously. I can tell you however I will compete to be one of the happiest students there :)! I will be among the group of random kids that walks to professors he's never had and starts asking questions, and the kids that have dinners/meals with professors too (that actually sounds really amazing!)</p>"

document.getElementById("text").innerHTML="MITRE Federal Systems Security Division<br><br><br>Paid Intern. Sept. 2012 ~ to date<br><br><br>I am building a Dynamic Reputation System for the Domain Name System (DNS), an essential Internet protocol used by both legitimate Internet applications and cyber attackers. The cyber attacker that my system helps to identify specifically is the APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) which is responsible for a number of attacks on government agencies, corporations and political activists. They focus on stealth and accessibility rather than the smash-and-grab approach and tend to be focused on a specific set of data which has been pre-researched.<br><br><br><br>The premise of the research is that that malicious, agile use of DNS has unique characteristics, such as DNS TTL Records which specify how long to keep a DNS Record. Through machine learning on query and network data, APTs and malicious attackers can be distinguished from legitimate DNS services. The system once fully operational will identify malicious domains weeks or even months before they appear in public blacklists and will be able to in an offline recognition capacity. I am conducting my work under the mentorship of Dept. Head Mr. Fayad Amgad and Dr. Steven Gianvecchio.<br><br><br>NIST, Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) (Summer 2012)<br><br><br>Bayesian uncertainty modeling for parametric systems (BUMPS). BUMPS is a component of a small angle neutron scattering (SANS) modeler. In SANS one is able to find intensity data at a particular location but not how it bounced off the surface to get to said location. In order to find the structure, you then simulate the model positions and calculate expected particle intensities. In order to calculate the probability distribution for certain positions in order to attempt to recover uncertainty. In order to do this, we used Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods (MCMC) which sampled the data to try and find the most probable (maximum likelihood estimation) as well as the one that fit the data the best.<br><br><br>The program uses expensive trajectory calculations as well as Markov Sampling Calculations and runs in parallel on a multicore server;I used a 48 core server. In order to take advantage of the multiple cores and reduce overhead, we looked into how to optimize the parallelization and efficiently combine the results from multiple Markov Chains.<br><br><br>In addition, I looked at optimization algorithm robustness (some of these were: the Nelder-Mead Simplex Algorithm, Newton\'s Method, Random Lines and Parallel Tempering) on a variable dimension Hermite spline in order to test successful convergence percentage and Markov chain convergence. To further determine Markov Chain Convergence, I looked at analytic convergence criterion for multidimensional Markov chains and multidimensional probability distributions. My work was done under the mentorship of scientist Paul Kienzle.";

Some other things:
<p> Two things I want to do but can't because I'm < 18 :(. Kaggle.com (tons cooler than USACO) & Mindsumo.com
</p>
<p>
So I unwisely randomly cut off a part of my activities description page, so here's part of that~ Eh.... somewhere.. let me find it &gt;_&lt; .. ok! so it's now on the main page (if you go to the homepage it's linked there).

<div id="text">

<p>It's kind of plain but I can make it look better if you want. -- Shomiron Ghose</p>
<p> It also depends on what webbrowser you're using because the different rendering engines don't like using the same gradient function :(.</p>
<p>Also if you can please use 1920x1080 resolution ~ it looks relatively the best. If your monitor can't do that zooming out a bit helps &lt;_&gt; sorry I haven't implemented CSS for different screen sizes. </p>
